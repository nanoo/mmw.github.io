        <p>There's something special about chainmaille. I can't quite put my finger on it. It's magical and durable, strong and flowing, ancient and modern. Working with it takes time, patience, and attention to detail.</p>

        <p>Creating pieces out of scalemaille is especially gratifying; you're literally weaving dragonhide! Whether itâ€™s armor or jewelry, you can't go wrong with scalemaille. And who doesn't like dragons?! (Except maybe the people of Laketown.)</p>
